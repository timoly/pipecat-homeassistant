Pipecat Assist brings realtime, multimodal Pipecat assistants to Home
Assistant. It lets you talk to speech-to-speech realtime models, build custom
Pipecat pipelines from cloud and local AI services, and keep Home Assistant
device control through MCP.

## What Pipecat Assist offers

- **Realtime voice assistants** over WebRTC, with Gemini Live as the default
  first-run speech-to-speech pipeline.
- **Custom pipeline builder** for speech-to-speech and composed realtime flows:
  mix STT, LLM, TTS, memory, web search, Home Assistant tools, and Pipecat
  Flows in one runtime profile.
- **Cloud provider integrations** for Gemini, OpenAI, Soniox, Deepgram,
  Speechmatics, Cartesia, Gradium, ElevenLabs, Google Cloud TTS, AWS Bedrock,
  AWS Nova Sonic, and OpenAI-compatible endpoints.
- **Local AI options** through Ollama, local runtime endpoints, and custom
  OpenAI-compatible services.
- **Multiple MCP servers**, including the built-in Home Assistant MCP server,
  the Home Assistant MCP add-on, and additional custom MCP endpoints.
- **Visual Pipecat Flow editing** for composed realtime pipelines, including
  conditional conversation graphs and MCP-backed tool calls.
- **Audio debugging, session memory, and web search** as first-class runtime
  features rather than hidden provider toggles.
- **Home Assistant AI Tasks support** for generated data and image-generation
  tasks, using dedicated image providers such as Google Imagen or fal.

## Where you can use it

- **Pipecat Assist add-on UI**: a full-width assistant card for quick browser
  testing and pipeline development.
- **Lovelace dashboard card**: a dedicated WebRTC card with live transcript,
  smooth scrolling, and the most responsive full-duplex conversation path.
- **Home Assistant Assist**: the custom component exposes Pipecat Assist as
  Conversation, Speech-to-text, and Text-to-speech.
- **Home Assistant AI Tasks / AI Actions**: Pipecat Assist can be selected for
  generated-data and image-generation tasks where your Home Assistant version
  exposes AI Task entities.
- **ESPHome voice satellites**: the included `va_pipecat` component provides
  wake-word turns, live transcripts, deterministic UI phases, follow-up
  conversation, and full-duplex barge-in over an authenticated raw-PCM
  WebSocket.
- **Pipecat ESP32 clients**: the existing SmallWebRTC `/api/offer` endpoint
  remains available for standalone `pipecat-esp32` firmware.

The Home Assistant Assist path uses an advanced Pipecat Live Bridge so HA
Assist can talk to speech-to-speech realtime assistants such as Gemini Live and
OpenAI Realtime. Because HA Assist itself is still not a full-duplex WebRTC
client, this bridge cannot provide true barge-in while the assistant is
speaking. The Lovelace card and add-on assistant card remain the more
responsive realtime experience.

## Installation

1. Add this repository URL to Home Assistant **Settings > Add-ons > Add-on
   Store > Repositories**:

   ```text
   https://github.com/kyvaith/pipecat-homeassistant
   ```

2. Add the same repository URL to **HACS > Custom repositories** as an
   **Integration**.

3. Install the **Pipecat Assist** add-on/app from the Home Assistant add-on
   store.

4. Install the **Pipecat Assist** custom component from HACS, then restart Home
   Assistant when HACS asks you to.

5. Add the Pipecat Assist integration in **Settings > Devices & services**. The
   integration should auto-detect the add-on URL; keep the detected value unless
   you run the add-on in a custom network layout.

6. In **Settings > Voice assistants**, select **Pipecat Assist** in all three
   categories:

   - Conversation agent / LLM
   - Speech-to-text
   - Text-to-speech

   Use the single Pipecat Assist language entry. The actual voice, language,
   and provider settings are configured inside the add-on pipeline.

7. Optional: where your Home Assistant version exposes **AI Tasks** or **AI
   Actions**, select **Pipecat Assist** for LLM task handling, generated data,
   and image generation. Configure **Integrations > Google Imagen** or
   **Integrations > fal Image Generation** in the add-on, then choose the image
   provider in **Runtime > Image task provider** when you want a specific
   backend instead of the first enabled one.

8. Open the Pipecat Assist add-on UI and configure a provider:

   - Easiest start: create a Google AI Studio API key and paste it into
     **Integrations > Google Gemini Live**.
   - Advanced setup: create or edit a custom pipeline with your preferred cloud
     providers, local AI endpoints, and MCP servers.

9. Add the **Pipecat Assist** Lovelace card to a dashboard and start talking.

```

## Quick start after installation

1. Start the add-on and open the web UI.
2. Open **Integrations > Home Assistant MCP** and click **Test MCP**. In a
   normal Home Assistant add-on install, Pipecat Assist uses the Supervisor
   token automatically.
3. Configure model providers. Gemini Live is the default, and additional
   providers such as OpenAI, Soniox, Deepgram, Cartesia, Gradium, Speechmatics,
   AWS, ElevenLabs, Google Cloud TTS HTTP fallback/Streaming,
   OpenAI-compatible endpoints, Ollama, local runtimes, and Web Search can be
   added from **Integrations**.
4. Choose or create a pipeline. The built-in catalog includes realtime
   speech-to-speech profiles and composed realtime profiles such as
   `Soniox + OpenAI + Cartesia`, `Deepgram + Gemini + Google TTS`, and
   `Speechmatics + AWS Nova Pro + ElevenLabs`.
5. For ESPHome, add the bundled `va_pipecat` external component and enable
   `api.custom_services`. The add-on discovers and provisions the satellite
   automatically. **Runtime > ESPHome satellite** also exposes a manual
   fallback endpoint.

Home Assistant MCP access uses the add-on's Supervisor token by default. Use
**Integrations > Home Assistant MCP > Automatic defaults** to clear custom MCP
overrides and return to the Supervisor-backed defaults. Manually pasted
long-lived access tokens are only needed for custom installations outside the
Supervisor path.

The optional **HA MCP Server Add-on** integration is detected automatically
through the Home Assistant Supervisor API. Pipecat Assist reads the add-on's
generated secret MCP URL and does not require a Bearer token for this
integration. Use Bearer tokens only for custom MCP servers that explicitly
require one.

Gemini Live is the default first-run pipeline. Add a Google AI Studio key in
**Integrations > Google Gemini Live**, keep
`models/gemini-3.1-flash-live-preview` as the realtime model, and use
**Assistant > Start voice test** to verify the browser voice path. The Home
Assistant Assist bridge is best-effort compatibility with the classic HA
Assist path; configure a composed pipeline for STT/TTS, install
`custom_components/pipecat_assist`, add the **Pipecat Assist** integration, and
select **Pipecat Assist** for Conversation, Speech-to-text, and Text-to-speech.

## Pipelines and Pipecat Flows

Pipecat Assist supports two realtime runtime families:

- **Speech-to-speech realtime**: Gemini Live, OpenAI Realtime, and AWS Nova
  Sonic take audio in and return audio directly. These are the lowest-friction
  profiles and Gemini Live remains the first-run default.
- **Composed realtime**: streaming STT, streaming LLM, and streaming TTS are
  chained by Pipecat. These pipelines are still realtime over WebRTC, but each
  stage can use a different provider. Compatible TTS providers can synthesize
  streamed LLM output in sentence or token chunks.

Provider integrations are intentionally split by capability. OpenAI Realtime
and Gemini Live are speech-to-speech providers; OpenAI Cloud and Google Gemini
Cloud are composed/text providers. Session Memory and Web Search are separate
pipeline steps. Web Search selects a cloud LLM provider such as OpenAI Cloud or
Google Gemini Cloud, while Home Assistant device control remains on MCP.

Official Pipecat Flows support (`pipecat.flows`) is enabled for composed
realtime pipelines. The flow editor stores nodes, transition functions, JSON
schemas, and optional Home Assistant MCP tool calls. For speech-to-speech
services, the UI disables the Pipecat Flow tile because Pipecat Flows does not
currently support Gemini Live, OpenAI Realtime, or OpenAI Live S2S APIs.

### OpenAI Live (`gpt-live-1`)

Select `gpt-live-1` as the realtime model of the **OpenAI Realtime**
integration or pipeline model step to use the full-duplex OpenAI Live API.
The live model decides itself when to answer and how to handle being talked
over, so the OpenAI VAD, transcription, noise-reduction, and barge-in settings
do not apply to it. Home Assistant MCP tools and Web Search are delegated to a
backend OpenAI text model: the pipeline's text model when it is an OpenAI
model, otherwise the OpenAI Cloud default model or `gpt-5.4-mini`. The reasoning
effort setting applies to that backend model.

OpenAI Live bills every minute a session is open, silence included. Browser
and Lovelace calls end after five minutes without speech. ESPHome `va_pipecat`
satellites keep their connection open from boot, so for them the add-on opens
a Live session per conversation: on the wake word (or when the microphone
starts streaming) and until the follow-up window runs out, the user stops the
conversation, the assistant says goodbye, or nothing is said for the
follow-up window plus 15 seconds. Microphone audio captured while the session
starts is sent once it is ready. Every second of the follow-up window is
billed, so consider lowering **Runtime > ESPHome satellite > Follow-up listening (ms)**
for OpenAI Live pipelines. Standalone `pipecat-esp32` clients use the same
`/api/offer` endpoint as browsers and hold a call open, so do not point an
always-connected device at an OpenAI Live pipeline.

## Home Assistant Assist and Lovelace

The custom component exposes Pipecat Assist in all three Home Assistant Assist
slots: Conversation, Speech-to-text, and Text-to-speech. Select the single
`pipecat-assist` language entry; the actual spoken language and voice remain
configured in the add-on pipeline and provider integrations. The HA Assist
bridge is not full-duplex like the Pipecat WebRTC path, but it lets standard HA
Assist entry points call the active Pipecat pipeline where the provider supports
the requested bridge operation.

The Lovelace card is served by the integration at
`/pipecat_assist/pipecat-assist-card.js`, is loaded automatically by the custom
component, and uses the same WebRTC assistant path as the add-on demo. It calls
the custom component proxy by default, so dashboard YAML does not need an
Ingress token or flow ID.

Useful card options:

```yaml
type: custom:pipecat-assist-card
name: Pipecat Assist
animation_on_idle: true
compact_mode: false
accent_color: "#206cff"
audio_buffer_ms: 120
```

`compact_mode` hides the transcript. `audio_buffer_ms` hints the browser WebRTC
jitter buffer; higher values can smooth playback with a small latency tradeoff.

## Audio debugging

Open **Runtime**, enable **Record audio in/out**, save, and then
run the browser voice test or connect a satellite. The add-on writes separate
WAV files for microphone input and assistant output under `/data/audio-debug`
and exposes download links in the Runtime panel. Use **Clear** after debugging,
because these files may contain private household audio.

## ESPHome satellites

The repository includes the `va_pipecat` ESPHome external component:

```yaml
external_components:
  - source: github://kyvaith/pipecat-homeassistant@dev
    components: [va_pipecat]

api:
  custom_services: true

va_pipecat:
  id: pipecat_va
  auto_provision: true
  microphone:
    microphone: processed_microphone
    channels: 0
  speaker: assistant_speaker
  barge_in: true
```

The add-on resolves the Home Assistant LAN host and sends the authenticated URL
through the device's native API action. No token-bearing text entity is
created. See [the component reference](components/va_pipecat/README.md) and
[architecture notes](docs/architecture/esphome-satellite.md) for the full
configuration and conversation lifecycle.

For the **Home Assistant Voice: Preview Edition** there is a ready
configuration in
[`components/va_pipecat/examples/home-assistant-voice-pe.yaml`](components/va_pipecat/examples/home-assistant-voice-pe.yaml).
It is the official configuration with the wake word wired to Pipecat Assist,
so the LED ring, buttons, timers, and media player keep working, and the
official firmware can be restored with the
[web installer](https://esphome.github.io/home-assistant-voice-pe/).

Standalone `pipecat-esp32` clients remain supported through the SmallWebRTC
`/api/offer` endpoint.

## Vision services

Moondream is a Pipecat vision service for image understanding and visual
question answering, not a text-to-image generator. It is therefore not exposed
as a Home Assistant image-generation backend in this release, but it is a good
candidate for future AI Tasks that analyze image attachments.

## Development

The add-on source is in `addons/pipecat_assist`.

```bash
python -m compileall addons/pipecat_assist/app custom_components/pipecat_assist
```

For the React UI:

```bash
cd addons/pipecat_assist/ui-src
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

For a container build:

```bash
docker build -t pipecat-assist:dev addons/pipecat_assist
```
